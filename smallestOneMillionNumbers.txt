	Describe an algorithm to find the smallest one million numbers in one billion
	numbers. Assume that the computer memory can hold all one billion numbers

The way I would do it is sort the numbers using quicksort O(nlogn) then return the first million number with O(1). Total speed complexity is therefore  O(nlogn)
